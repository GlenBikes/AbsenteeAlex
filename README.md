A parody Twitter bot of Seattle City Council D4 candidate Alex Pedersen
=======================================================================

*(work in progress...)*

**Note:** You can see the bot [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/absenteealex/with_replies).

Alex Pedersen avoids most public forums and candidate endorsement questionnaires. 
This is because he doesn't actually have any policy positions and since Amazon and the 
Seattle Chamber of Commerce are buying him a City Council seat, he really doesn't need any.
